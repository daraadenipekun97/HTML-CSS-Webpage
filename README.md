# HTML-CSS-Webpage
Hello readers this is a readme i added just to give a brief about this website.
The website is a replica of a bootstrap website from the link: https://templatemo.com/live/templatemo_468_onetel
I decided to clone it and customize it to my taste. I made use of HTML and CSS only for the styling and responsiveness I also used a little bit of javascript to hide and show the menu bar in the desktop and mobile view respectively.I was able to complete this project within 2 days.
Thanks for reading,
yours Sincerely.
